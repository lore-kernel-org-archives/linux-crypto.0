I don't think big_key even needs randomness at init time.  The 'big_key_rng'
could just be removed and big_key_gen_enckey() changed to call
get_random_bytes().  (Or get_random_bytes_wait(), I guess; it's only reachable
via the keyring syscalls.)

It's going to take a while to go through all 217 users of get_random_bytes()
like this, though...  It's really a shame there's no way to guarantee good
randomness at boot time.
