Hi Greg,

Thanks for the review. Responses to your suggestions are inline below:

I didn't know this was a rule. Since I had seen a hodgepodge
throughout the kernel I just sort of assumed it was a free for all.
I've fixed this up for v2, and I've also gone through all of my other
[not yet submitted] code and made this change.

Public domain, actually. I'll add notice of this to the header.

Thanks!

le64_to_cpup doesn't take the right type. But I agree the macro is not
the nicest way to do this. Instead, I'll copy what
crypto/chacha20_generic.c does and define locally le64_to_cpuvp which
takes a void pointer:

static inline u64 le64_to_cpuvp(const void *p)
{
        return le64_to_cpup(p);
}

It tells gcc to unroll the loops. Comparing the assembly, it looks
like on x86_64, gcc does twice as many rounds per loop iteration when
asked to unroll the loops. This allows the code to remain neat and
straightforward, while instructing gcc to do the gnarly part.

Is this too much rice? Have I been Gentoo-ing for too long? Or are
limited uses of unroll-loops acceptable?

Done.

Since it's public domain, EXPORT_SYMBOL() is fine.

If you have some reason for preferring GPL2 over public domain, I'm
happy to make the change. Maybe you want to preclude the new&shiny
from proprietary modules? That's fine with me, if you desire it being
that way.

Ack.

I started to do this, but couldn't make up my mind, and then resigned
to -1. I'll redouble my efforts to pick something decent.

Ack.

There is crypto/testmgr.c, but it's designed for testing things that
use the actual crypto API. Clearly for a hashtable function, nobody
would accept the overhead of the enormous crypto API, so siphash has
to remain an ordinary fast function call. Also, it lives in lib/, not
in crypto/. For that reason, I thought that Herbert might object if I
clutter up his testmgr with non crypto API functions. I'll CC him on
this email to double check.

Here's where the controversy begins! As we've seen from this thread,
there are two hurdles:

1. Convincing people that the cryptographic properties of siphash are
important, and jhash does not have these. I think JP Aumasson's email
described things pretty clearly, and this isn't really up for debate
anymore.
2. Convincing people that for a particular use case, siphash _is_
sufficiently fast, and that any potential (tiny) slowdown, compared to
insecure function like jhash, is either a) not worth having a
known-vulnerability or b) not even measurably relavent for the actual
real life workload.

I suspect that the debates about (2.a) and (2.b) will need to be duked
out one-by-one for a bit of time. I thought that since this will be
more of an evolutionary change, it'd be best to at least get the
primitives into lib/ so they can actually be used.

For example, I found some patches from George Spelvin (CC'd) trying to
get this added a few years back, for reasons related to extfs code. I
found a discussion between Scott Bauer (CC'd) and Andy&Andi (CC'd)
about adding siphash for the purpose of SROP mitigation, but not doing
so because there wasn't the primitive in lib/.

Seeing that siphash is both a solution to current existing problems,
future security mechanisms, and current things people clearly seem to
want, I thought it might be worthwhile to add this straight-up.

But if you really really want me to submit this alongside a patch
series of places that could be changed, I guess I could take the time
to pick out the most uncontroversial places -- some network stack /
netfilter places, some userspace API hashtable DoS places, etc -- but
I fear that's going to drag so many different consumers into the fold
that in the end nothing will get merged. So I think this might be a
good case for an exception with /lib, as a means of making forward
progress in general. Feel free to disagree, though; you know best.

Regards,
Jason
