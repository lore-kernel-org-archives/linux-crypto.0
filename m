I think the akcipher operations for sign/verify/encrypt/decrypt should operate on asymmetric keys in the first place. With akcipher you are pretty much bound to public and private keys and the key is the important part and not the akcipher itself. Especially since we want to support private keys in hardware (like TPM for example).

If we would have something like this:

diff --git a/include/uapi/linux/if_alg.h b/include/uapi/linux/if_alg.h
index f2acd2f..02e6162 100644
--- a/include/uapi/linux/if_alg.h
+++ b/include/uapi/linux/if_alg.h
@@ -34,9 +34,12 @@ struct af_alg_iv {
 #define ALG_SET_OP			3
 #define ALG_SET_AEAD_ASSOCLEN		4
 #define ALG_SET_AEAD_AUTHSIZE		5
+#define ALG_SET_PUBKEY			6
+#define ALG_SET_PUBKEY_ID		7

in case of ALG_SET_PUBKEY the key will be provided by user space
and in case of ALG_SET_PUBKEY_ID the PF_ALG layer will retrieve the
key from the keyring using the ID provided form user space.
Will this be ok with you Marcel and David?
Thanks,
