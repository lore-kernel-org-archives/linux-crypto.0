There has been discussion as well as (I think) initial patches merged 
for support of specifying the compression level for algorithms which 
support multiple compression levels in BTRFS.  I was actually under the 
impression that we had decided to use level 3 as the default for zstd, 
but that apparently isn't the case, and with the benchmark issues, it 
may not be once proper benchmarks are run.

Also, on the note of compressing in userspace, the use case I quoted at 
least can't do that because we have to deal with Windows clients and 
users have to be able to open files directly on said Windows clients.  I 
entirely agree that real archival storage is better off using userspace 
compression, but sometimes real archival storage isn't an option.

Part of that is the fact that BTRFS is one of the only consumers (AFAIK) 
of this API that can freely choose all aspects of their usage, and the 
consensus here (which I don't agree with I might add) amounts to the 
argument that 'we already have <X> compression with a <Y> compression 
ratio, we don't need more things like that'.  I would personally love to 
see LZ4HC support in BTRFS (based on testing my own use cases, LZ4 is 
more deterministic than LZO for both compression and decompression, and 
most of the non archival usage I have of BTRFS benefits from 
determinism), but there's not any point in me writing up such a patch 
because it's almost certain to get rejected because BTRFS already has 
LZO.  The main reason that zstd is getting considered at all is that the 
quoted benchmarks show clear benefits in decompression speed relative to 
zlib and far better compression ratios than LZO.
