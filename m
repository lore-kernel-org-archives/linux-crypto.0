High five for taking the deep dive and actually reading how this all
works. Nice bug!

The kernel is vast and filled with tons of bugs of many sorts. On this
reasoning, maybe I should spend my time auditing web apps instead,
which are usually the "front door" of bugs? I like the puzzles of
random.c. I also had a real world need for wait_for_random_bytes() in
a module I'm writing.

But anyway, your general point is a really good one. Tons of callers
of the random functions are doing it wrong in one way or another.
Spending time looking at those is probably a good idea...

Great, thanks.
