That is a very good idea.

To cover that approach, the kernel needs to be informed about the length of 
the authentication data size to separate the ciphertext/plaintext from the 
authentication data.

To cover that, I would recommend to simply send a u32 value to the kernel for 
the AD size instead of the AD. The kernel then can adjust the pointers as 
necessary.

I will update the patch in the next days to cover that scenario.

Thanks
