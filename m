Right, I need to have a local buffer for the digest here.

After the verify operation the output will be copied to the user,
and the user needs to verify it.

The output of crypto_akcipher_verify() is discarded before public_key_verify_signature() returns so nothing ends up in req->dst to read from the socket.

Then that data could be packaged up in req as if crypto_akcipher_verify() had been called. I don't know if this change confuses the semantics of verify_signature() too much, maybe a new function is required with all the requisite plumbing to the asymmetric key subtype.

We need to copy output to the user to verify because we don't have it.
That will be consistent for both ALG_SET_PUBKEY and ALG_SET_PUBKEY_ID.
Thanks for your comments and sorry for the delayed response. I'll will send v7 soon.
