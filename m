I agree that the use of ECB mode in big_key is broken, and thanks for trying to
fix it!  I think using GCM is good, but please leave a very conspicuous comment
where the nonce is being set to 0, noting that it's safe only because a unique
key is used to encrypt every big_key *and* the big_keys are not updatable (via
an .update method in the key_type), resulting in each GCM key being used for
only a single encryption.

Also, I think you should send this to the keyrings mailing list and maintainer
so it can be discussed and merged separately from your RNG changes.

Eric
