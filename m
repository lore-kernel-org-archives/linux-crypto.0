As I want to send a new version of the algif_akcipher shortly now (hoping for 
an inclusion into 4.8), is there anything you see that I should prepare for 
regarding this issue? I.e. do you forsee a potential fix that would change the 
API or ABI of algif_akcipher?

That is a good one :-)

I have that check removed.
