Or more likely it'll be used like this

	get_random(foo);		/* always works */


Now the existing failure mode is is

	open(...)
	/* forget the check */
	read()
	/* forget the check */

and triggered by evil local attacks on file handles. The "improved"
behaviour is unchecked -ENOSYS returns which are likely to occur
systemically when users run stuff on old kernels, in vm's with it off etc.

So you've swapped the odd evil user attack on a single target for the
likelyhood of mass generation of flawed keys with no error reporting.

In fact you could do a better job of the whole mess in libc rather than
the kernel, because in libc you'd write it like this

         if (open(.. ) < 0)
		kill(getpid(), 9);
	 if (read(...) < expected)
		kill(getpid(), 9);
	 close(fd);

and 
a) on an older library you'd get a good failure (unable to execute the
binary)
b) on a newer system you'd get "do or die" behaviour and can improve its
robustness as desired
