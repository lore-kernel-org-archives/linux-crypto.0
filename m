Could you give some more concrete details/examples? Here's the IPv4
hash table from include/net/inet_sock.h / net/ipv4/inet_hashtables.c:

static inline unsigned int __inet_ehashfn(const __be32 laddr,
                                         const __u16 lport,
                                         const __be32 faddr,
                                         const __be16 fport,
                                         u32 initval)
{
       return jhash_3words((__force __u32) laddr,
                           (__force __u32) faddr,
                           ((__u32) lport) << 16 | (__force __u32)fport,
                           initval);
}

static u32 inet_ehashfn(const struct net *net, const __be32 laddr,
                       const __u16 lport, const __be32 faddr,
                       const __be16 fport)
{
       static u32 inet_ehash_secret __read_mostly;

       net_get_random_once(&inet_ehash_secret, sizeof(inet_ehash_secret));

       return __inet_ehashfn(laddr, lport, faddr, fport,
                             inet_ehash_secret + net_hash_mix(net));
}

There's a 32-bit secret random salt (inet_ehash_secret) which means
that in practice, inet_ehashfn() will select 1 out of 2^32 different
hash functions at random each time you boot the kernel; without
knowing which one it selected, how can a local or remote attacker can
force IPv4 connections/whatever to go into a single hash bucket?

It is not possible to obtain the secret salt directly (except by
reading from kernel memory, in which case you've lost already), nor is
it possible to obtain the result of inet_ehashfn() other than (maybe)
by a timing attack where you somehow need to detect that two
connections went into the same hash bucket and work backwards from
that to figure out how to land more connections into into the same
bucket -- but if they can do that, you've also already lost.

The same pattern is used for IPv6 hashtables and the dentry cache.

I suppose that using a hash function proven to be cryptographically
secure gives a hard guarantee (under some assumptions) that the
salt/key will give enough diversity between the (in the example above)
2^32 different hash functions that you cannot improve your chances of
guessing that two values will map to the same bucket regardless of the
salt/key. However, I am a bit doubtful that using a cryptographically
secure hash function will make much of a difference as long as the
attacker doesn't actually have any way to get the output/result of the
hash function (and given that the hash function isn't completely
trivial, of course).

I am happy to be proven wrong, but you make it sound very easy to
exploit the current situation, so I would just like to ask whether you
have a concrete way to do that?
