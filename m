Yes please.

powerpc supports a wide range of hardware platforms, some of which are
10-15 years old, and don't have a hardware RNG.

Is there anything we can do on those machines? Seems like our only
option would be to block the boot while some more "entropy" builds up,
but that's unlikely to be popular with users.

On our newer machines (>= Power8) we have a hardware RNG which we wire
up to arch_get_random_seed_long(), so on those machines the warnings
would be valid, because they'd indicate a bug.

So I think it should be up to arches to decide whether this is turned on
via their defconfigs, and the default should be 'n' because a lot of old
hardware won't be able to do anything useful with the warnings.

cheers
