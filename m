Hi,
Ok, It looks to me that we *do* have all we need to implement zero copy
and AIO with algif_skcipher. The only thing we need to do is to add
support for it in skcipher_recvmsg(). I think no change is required in
neither skcipher_sendmsg(), skcipher_sendpage(), nor the if_alg interface.
Then to start using the interface asynchronously an application will
need to call aio_read() or lio_listio() instead of read(), but if
someone will use read(), then it will still work in the same
(synchronous) way as it is today.
How does this sound to you, Herbert?
I'll send a v2 shortly.
Thanks,
Tadeusz
