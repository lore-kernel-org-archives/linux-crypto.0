I think you might have just missed the kbuild test robot complaining
about an incorrect compiler warning, when using an ancient gcc for the
sh platform. I fixed that bug in v5, which I posted about an hour
ago. The only change was a single commit, so you can just cherry-pick
that as you wish:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/zx2c4/linux.git/patch/?id=2f390fd961d1f97738d7af4f4797542e05f4607e

Other than that one commit change, it was the same.

Or, if it's easier, the tag for-random-4.12 in
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/random.git is for you.
