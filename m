Okay so it sounds like certain controllers will use this and certain
won't, and so it might be slightly complicated to follow the mouse
through the tube ideally. In that case, I'd recommend continuing with
this current patchset, which just adds the wait (which is a no-op if
it's already seeded) close to the actual call sites.

Can you review that patch and give your Signed-off-by if it looks good?
