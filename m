Except that it's all backwards: these are things that default to *on*,
and people might want them to turn off.  capable() is totally fscked
if you want otherwise unprivileged users to carry capabilities around,
and fixing it seems to run into endless claims that the "capability"
system is carefully designed, flawless, perfect, ideal, amazing, and
shouldn't be changed, despite the fact that it's empirically damn near
useless.

Also, capabilities do the wrong thing wrt namespaces.  The things I'm
talking about aren't namespaced.  They're either on or off.
