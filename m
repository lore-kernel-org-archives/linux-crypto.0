Albeit that all sounds like the crown jewel, how do you propose that sh=
all=20
happen?

Assume that you have a web server that has a pub and priv key in its cu=
rrent=20
configuration -- I guess that is the vast majority of configs.

Can you please elaborate how the process for such a web server shall re=
ally=20
work?


Ciao
