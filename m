The Open BSD folks would disagree with you.  They've designed their
whole system around saving entropy at shutdown, reading it as early as
possible by the bootloader, and then as soon as possible after the
reboot, to overwrite and reinitialize the entropy seed stored on disk
so that on a reboot after a crash.  They consider this good enough to
assume that their CRNG is *always* strongly initialized.

I'll let you have that discussion/argument with Theo de Raadt, though.
Be warned that he has opinions about security that are almost
certainly as strong (and held with the same level of certainty) as a
certain Brad Spengler...
