We don't start an AEAD operation until the entire input has been
received.  Unlike ciphers you cannot process AEAD requests as you
go.

So there is no need to special-case AD chunks since you will have
everything at your disposal before you can feed the request to the
crypto API.

AD is not like an IV at all.  An IV is a fixed-size (and small)
input while AD can be of any length.

Think about how this is used in real life.  For IPsec AD is the part
of the packet that we don't encrypt.  So there is nothing fundamentally
different between AD and the plain-text that we do encrypt except
that you don't encrypt it :)
