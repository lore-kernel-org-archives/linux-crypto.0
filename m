=46irst of all, I personally would not insist on an AF_ALG for pure akc=
ipher=20
externalization. Integrating it with the key subsystem looks like a fin=
e idea.

But that would imply that we tie the crypto API quite hard with the key=
=20
retention system which I guess may not be warranted.

Note, I was playing with the idea of using the key retention system for=
 the=20
kernel crypto API myself (hence also my patch to add key wrapping suppo=
rt=20
which has its roots there).

But having a tie between both, the kernel crypto API and the key system=
, that=20
cannot be cut any more is something I am not sure about. Both should an=
d would=20
work in isolation of each other as both serve different needs.

But I agree that when having both and the user wants proper key managem=
ent,=20
the key system should be used. But isn't that already a policy decision=
 of the=20
user/administrator? IIRC, the kernel should not hard-wire policies that=
 may or=20
may not be wanted by user space. Hence, the decision about connecting b=
oth=20
systems should rest in user space. And the kernel should support a join=
t=20
operation of both.
