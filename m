A key stored in hardware and used through that hardware won't necessarily
support all crypto operations - it may be restricted to just signing or just
encrypting for example.

I think the crypto API is what we use when the key data is available to us in
the kernel - but it should be driven through the asymmetric key API.  You ask
the asymmetric key API to verify a key, say, then that will switch to the TPM
driver or to the software public key implementation.  The latter will then
load the appropriate crypto layer akcipher algorithm (eg. RSA) and use that -
where the akcipher implementation will either be a software one or will get
offloaded to some hardware that can do it - but that doesn't itself securely
hold the key.
