I did btrfs benchmarks of kernel trees and other normal data sets as 
well.  The numbers were in line with what Nick is posting here.  zstd is 
a big win over both lzo and zlib from a btrfs point of view.

It's true Nick's patches only support a single compression level in 
btrfs, but that's because btrfs doesn't have a way to pass in the 
compression ratio.  It could easily be a mount option, it was just 
outside the scope of Nick's initial work.
