Holy cow, please cool it. I think the "or less" part was relevant, as
was the subsequent sentence which characterized that sentiment as
"hubris". Also, the subsequent email when I made explicit the fact
that I was more in agreement with you than you interpreted. So, in
case you're really really really not getting the message I'm trying to
make so explicitly clear to you: I AGREE WITH YOU. So, no more
punching, pretty please?

I don't think it will be easy. I agree with you.

Other platforms will be hard. I agree with you.

I'm going to roll Kees' suggestion into a PATCH and send it to you.
You can decide if you want to apply it. I'll be satisfied with
whatever you choose and will follow your lead.
