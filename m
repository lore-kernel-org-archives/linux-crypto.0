Why? They're all marked as ASYNC AFAIK.

Having 0 as type and CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC as mask in general means
that we're requesting a sync algorithm (i.e., ASYNC bit off).

However, it is completely unnecessary for shash as they can never
be async.  So this could be changed to just ("michael_mic", 0, 0).

It does through skcipher if you allocate with (0, CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC).

I'll try to fix this.

Sure I'll take a look.
