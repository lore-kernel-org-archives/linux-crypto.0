I am always uneasy when the kernel has a user space interface and expects 
layers deep down inside the kernel to check for user space related boundaries. 
Note, we do not hand the __user flag down, so sparse and other tools cannot 
detect whether a particular cipher implementation has the right checks.

I therefore always would like to check parameters at the interface handling 
logic. Cryptographers rightly should worry about their code implementing the 
cipher correctly. But I do not think that the cipher implementations should 
worry about security implications since they may be called from user space.

Is your concern that we have a double check check for lengths here? If yes, I 
think we can live with an additional if() here.

Or is your concern that the user space interface restricts things too much and 
thus prevents a valid use case?
