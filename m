I more or less agree with you that we should just turn this on for all
users and they'll just have to live with the spam and report odd
entries, and overtime we'll fix all the violations.

But I think there's another camp that would mutiny in the face of this
kind of hubris.

That's why I moved pretty readily toward the compromise position of
default y, but depends on DEBUG_KERNEL. My hope was that it'd to an
extent satisfy both camps, and also disappoint both camps in an equal
way.
