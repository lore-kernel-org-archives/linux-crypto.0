Are you saying that you consider importing parts of TLS into the kernel? 
Considering the use case where akcipher would be used to speed up network 
protocols, I would imply that your comment refers to importing parts of that 
network protocol into the kernel.

The key derivation that you mention here would be: RSA-based key exchange plus 
the TLS KDF. Do we really want to load that into the kernel given that TLS is 
one protocol and there are many others?
