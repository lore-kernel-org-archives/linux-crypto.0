Yes yes, bla bla, predictable response. I don't care. Your API is
still broken. Excuses excuses. Yes, somebody needs to do the work in
the end, maybe that person can be me, maybe you, maybe somebody else.
Regardless, we can take this to a different thread if you'd like to
bikeshed about that particular point for another five millennia. But
that isn't the main topic of this thread, so I'm not going to get
sucked into that blackhole.

While we're on the topic of that, you might consider adding a simple
synchronous interface. I realize that the get_blocking_random_bytes
attempt was aborted as soon as it began, because of issues of
cancelability, but you could just expose the usual array of wait,
wait_interruptable, wait_killable, etc, or just make that wait object
and condition non-static so others can use it as needed. Having to
wrap the current asynchronous API like this kludge is kind of a
downer:

That's a good point. In my initial email I looked down on the
whack-a-mole approach, because nobody is ever going to analyze all of
those cases. But... if dmesgs are going wild for some people, we'll
have upset users doing the hard work for us. So maybe it's worthwhile
to turn that warning on by default.

No, what it means is that the particularities of individual examples I
picked at random don't matter. Are we really going to take the time to
audit each and every callsite to see "do they need actually random
data? can this be called pre-userspace?" I mentioned this in my
initial email. As I said there, I think analyzing all the cases one by
one is fragile, and more will pop up, and that's not really the right
way to approach this. And furthermore, as alluded to above, even
fixing clearly-broken places means using that hard-to-use asynchronous
API, which adds even more potentially buggy TCB to these drivers and
all the rest. Not a good strategy.

Seeing as you took the time to actually respond to the
_particularities_ of each individual random example I picked could
indicate that you've missed this point prior.

Glad we're on the same page about that.

Right, it was him and Stephan (CCd). They initially started by adding
get_blocking_random_bytes, but then replaced this with the
asynchronous one, because they realized it could block forever. As I
said above, though, I still think a blocking API would be useful,
perhaps just with more granularity for the way in which it blocks.

"We shouldn't fix legitimate cryptographic bugs, because the rest of
our codebase is too buggy to support anything reasonable."
Sounds like it'd be worthwhile to begin fixing things in this fashion, then.

In fixing those bugs where it's clearly not necessary, I guess you're
right then.

Please don't think of this example as THE instance where it matters. I
seriously just opened a few files from my grep at random. That this
one wound up being a particularly relevant one is just chance. Other
dragons lurk below, beware.

What would you think of just removing the #ifdef completely?
