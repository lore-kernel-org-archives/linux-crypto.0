Ok, I can change that throughout the code.

Sorry, I was not clear:

* I need to catch a failing memcpy, but not return an error.

* I unconditionally use the memset after memcpy as you indicated. Once 
the cryptodev tree contains the memzero_explicit call, I will start 
picking up that function.

Essentially, I throught of the line you suggested.
