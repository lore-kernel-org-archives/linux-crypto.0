I don't believe it has anything to do with insanity. Its sound
security engineering.

Are there compelling reasons a single dmesg warning cannot be provided?

A single message avoids spamming the logs. It also informs the system
owner of the problem. An individual or organization can then take
action based on their risk posture. Finally, it avoids the kernel
making policy decisions for a user or organization.
