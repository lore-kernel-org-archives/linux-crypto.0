But then would you like to extend AIO interface to take the IV and
something that would indicate the encrypt/decrypt operation on
aio_write()? Also as far as I can see AIO doesn't support splice()
operation for zero copy, which is the main thing here.

anyway, is it not?

If you have a better way how to indicate that data processing should
start on the last page in sendpage() instead of ALG_OP_IN_PLACE I would
be happy to use it.
Thanks,
Tadeusz
