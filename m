I can't speak for others, but for me: I think they will fall into
three categories:

 1. easy to fix
 2. difficult to fix
 3. unable to fix

(1) is low hanging fruit and they will probably (hopefully?) be
cleared easily.  Like systemd on x86_64 with rdrand and rdseed.
There's no reason for systemd to find itself starved of entropy on
that platform. (cf., http://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/4167).

Organizations that find themselves in (3) can choose to use a board or
server and accept the risk, or they can choose to remediate it in
another way. The "other way" may include a capital expenditure and a
hardware refresh.

The central point is, they know about the risk and they can make the decision.
