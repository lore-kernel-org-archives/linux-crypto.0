I am not surprised --- Zstandard is closer to the state of the art, both
format-wise and implementation-wise, than the other choices in BTRFS.  My point
is that benchmarks need to account for how much data is compressed at a time.
This is a common mistake when comparing different compression algorithms; the
algorithm name and compression level do not tell the whole story.  The
dictionary size is extremely significant.  No one is going to compress or
decompress a 200 MB file as a single stream in kernel mode, so it does not make
sense to justify adding Zstandard *to the kernel* based on such a benchmark.  It
is going to be divided into chunks.  How big are the chunks in BTRFS?  I thought
that it compressed only one page (4 KiB) at a time, but I hope that has been, or
is being, improved; 32 KiB - 128 KiB should be a better amount.  (And if the
amount of data compressed at a time happens to be different between the
different algorithms, note that BTRFS benchmarks are likely to be measuring that
as much as the algorithms themselves.)
