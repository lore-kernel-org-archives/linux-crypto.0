I personally do not fully agree here. For our day-to-day desktops and servers 
I would fully and completely agree. But I see other use cases of Linux in 
routers or other embedded systems where there may be other checks and balances 
in place where this hard demand is not warranted.

Thus, I feel that this is a policy decision to be made in user space (see my 
other email -- please answer on that topic there to keep a single thread).

Do not get me wrong, my patch is shall be there for all to comment. I have no 
issues when we find a better solution. And I also do not like multiple 
interfaces that would not be needed if we would have thought better.

With all due respect, I would object here. When we say yes to TLS (even if it 
is parts of TLS up to the point where the KDF happens), we invite all higher 
level crypto implementations: IKE, SNMP, SSH -- I would not want to go down 
that path that started by simply supporting accelerated asymmetric ciphers.

Look at user space crypto libs: where is the most fuzz happening? Not in the 
cipher implementations, but in the network protocols.
