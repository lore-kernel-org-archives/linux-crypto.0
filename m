To the former point, recall the signature of recv:
ssize_t recv(int sockfd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags);

Traditionally, userspace apps can know that the buffer provided to recv=
=20
was too small in two ways:

The return value from recv / recvmsg was >=3D len.

In the case of recvmsg, the MSG_TRUNC flag is set.

To quote man recv:

"All  three calls return the length of the message on successful comple=
=E2=80=90
tion.  If a message is too long to fit in the supplied  buffer,  excess
bytes  may  be discarded depending on the type of socket the message is
received from."

and

"MSG_TRUNC (since Linux 2.2)

	For   raw   (AF_PACKET),   Internet   datagram   (since    Linux
	2.4.27/2.6.8),  netlink  (since Linux 2.6.22), and UNIX datagram
	(since Linux 3.4) sockets: return the real length of the  packet
	or datagram, even when it was longer than the passed buffer.
"
