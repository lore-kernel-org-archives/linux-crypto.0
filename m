So it looks like you've gone with 4a072c71f49. If that looks good
(moving the lock, etc) to you, then great, we're done. If there are
still locking objections (are there?), then we'll need to revisit.

In the v1 of this patch many moons ago, it was just vanilla, default y,
but due to the spamminess, I thought folks would revolt. So I made a
change:

Specifically, I added `depends on DEBUG_KERNEL`. This means that these
useful warnings will only poke other kernel developers. This is probably
exactly what we want. If the various associated developers see a warning
coming from their particular subsystem, they'll be more motivated to
fix it. Ordinary users on distribution kernels shouldn't see the
warnings or the spam at all, since typically users aren't using
DEBUG_KERNEL.

Then, to make things _even less_ annoying to kernel developers, you
added a nice patch on top to squelch repeated messages.

So, I still think this current strategy is a good one, of default y, but
depends on DEBUG_KERNEL.

Regards,
Jason
