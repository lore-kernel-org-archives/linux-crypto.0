metze, Thanks. I think the patch is working.

cifsa.nopatch and cifsa.patch were created as symlinks using mount
option mfsymlinks
without and with this patch respectively.

 # mount -t cifs //<server_name>/<share_name> /mnt/smb_c -o
user=3D<user>,pass=3D<password>

# md5sum /mnt/smb_c/cifsa.nopatch
d1077212b3a759439645e1fee8d6a268  /mnt/smb_c/cifsa.nopatch

# md5sum /mnt/smb_c/cifsa.patch
d1077212b3a759439645e1fee8d6a268  /mnt/smb_c/cifsa.patch

I tried this with another actualpath file and md5sum of both the
created symlinks (with
and without the patch) is same.
