The way verify_signature is implemented today, the only output is the 
return code. For verify, maybe no read is required (just sendmsg() and 
check the return code).

But this isn't the extent of the problem: verify_signature needs both the 
signature to be verified and the expected hash as inputs. How is the 
expected hash provided? Would you include it as a cmsg header?
ALG_OP_VERIFY should have consistent inputs and outputs whether the key 
was set with ALG_SET_KEY_ID or ALG_SET_KEY.
