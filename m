Modifying the kernel image on storage isn't compatible with verified
boot so it's not really a solution. The kernel, initrd and rest of the
OS are signed and verified on operating systems like Android, Android
Things, ChromeOS and many embedded devices, etc. putting some basic
effort into security. I didn't really understand the device tree
approach and mentioned a few times before. Passing via the kernel
cmdline is a lot simpler than modifying the device tree in-memory and
persistent modification isn't an option unless verified boot is missing
anyway.
