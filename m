Any metadata such as the IV can still go through the existing
sendmsg interface, just as you would do a sendmsg before a sendfile
to set things up.

The AIO interface itself can accomodate zero-copy.  It's just that
we currently don't have any support for it in the network socket
API.

Yes but you're violating the meaning of sendpage().  The latter
is not crypto-specific so you shouldn't be adding things that
prevent future optimisations to it.
