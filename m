The signature of verify_signature() is quite different from the other
new public key handlers, i.e. create_signature(), encrypt_blob(), and
decrypt_blob(). For verify_signature() we need the following parameters:
encrypted src, hash function to use, expected digest.
The expected digest could be optional if we would modify the
verify_signature() to return the decrypted buffer.
I think the best solution for now would be to just return -ENOPROTOOPT
for verify_signature in SET_KEY_ID mode.
All the four operations will be supported in the SET_KEY mode and
all but verify_signature() will be supported in the SET_KEY_ID mode.
This can added later if we will find a way to pass all parameters in a
consistent way. What do you think? If you are ok with that I will send a
new version soon.
Thanks,
