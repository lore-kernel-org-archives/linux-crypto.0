SipHash co-designer here.

SipHash is secure when it takes a secret key/seed as parameter, meaning
that its output values are unpredictable. Concretely, when SipHash produces
64-bit output values then you've a chance 1/2^64 to guess the hash value of
a given message, provided that the key/seed is kept secret. That's the
standard security definition of a pseudorandom function (PRF), which is
typically instantiated with a MAC such as HMAC-somehash.

With djb we demonstrated that this security notion is sufficient to protect
from hash-flooding attacks wherein an attacker creates many different input
values that hash to a same value and therefore may DoS the underlying data
structure.

I admit that the naming is confusing: "SipHash" is not a hash function,
strictly speaking. In crypto we only call hash function algorithms that are
unkeyed. PRFs/MACs are sometimes called keyed hash functions though.
