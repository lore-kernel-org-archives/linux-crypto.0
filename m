Any that are called only by kernel threads would theoretically be safe since
kernel threads don't ordinarily receive signals.  But I think that at least the
drbg and gcm waits can be reached by user threads, since they can be called via
algif_rng and algif_aead respectively.

I recommend putting any important fixes first, so they can be backported without
depending on crypto_wait_req().
