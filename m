How about doing this:

   default DEBUG_KERNEL

Most distro kernel select DEBUG_KERNEL because it unhides a bunch of
other useful configs. Since it doesn't strictly _depend_ on
DEBUG_KERNEL, I think it's probably a mistake to enforce a false
dependency. Using it as a hint for the default seems maybe like a good
middle ground. (And if people can't agree on that, then I guess
"default n"...)
