The compression algorithm is considered part of the filesystem format
and must be covered by an incompatibility bit. Regarding the acomp API,
I don't see much point adding the extra abstraction layer for the two
currently supported algorithms. We only call 2 functions, for
compression and decompression, no need to allocate the acomp helper
structures and call the functions indirectly.
