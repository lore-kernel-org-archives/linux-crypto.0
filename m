FWIW, EFI has an (optional) EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL, that we currently use to
seed the kernel's entropy pool. The EFI stub creates a config table with
the entropy, which the kernel reads.

This is re-seeded prior to kexec() to avoid the entropy being recycled.

See commits:

636259880a7e7d34 ("efi: Add support for seeding the RNG from a UEFI config table")
568bc4e87033d232 (" efi/arm*/libstub: Invoke EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL to seed the UEFI RNG table")

Unfortunately, I beleive that support for the protocol is currently rare
in practice.

Thanks,
Mark.
