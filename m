Well, for a very loose definition of "approaching", and certainly not at the
same time.  I doubt there's a use case for using the highest compression levels
in kernel mode --- especially the ones using zstd_opt.h.

It would be easier to compare to the upstream version if it was not all
reformatted.  There is a chance that bugs were introduced by Linux-specific
changes, and it would be nice if they could be easily reviewed.  (Also I don't
know what clang-format settings you used, but there are still a lot of
differences from the Linux coding style.)

Theses benchmarks are misleading because they compress the whole file as a
single stream without resetting the dictionary, which isn't how data will
typically be compressed in kernel mode.  With filesystem compression the data
has to be divided into small chunks that can each be decompressed independently.
That eliminates one of the primary advantages of Zstandard (support for large
dictionary sizes).
