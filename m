Userspace or not, buffer lengths need to be strictly checked.

The latter - my primary concern is the constraint this places on userspace 
by forcing larger buffer sizes than might be necessary for the operation. 
struct akcipher_request has separate members for src_len and dst_len, and 
dst_len is documented as needing "to be at least as big as the expected 
result depending on the operation". Not the maximum result, the expected 
result. It's also documented that the cipher will generate an error if 
dst_len is insufficient and update the value with the required size.

I'm updating some userspace TLS code that worked with an earlier, unmerged 
patch set for AF_ALG akcipher (from last year). The read calls with 
shorter buffers were the main porting problem.
