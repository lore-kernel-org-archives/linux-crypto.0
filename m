Yes, I'm sure. You moved the call to invalidate_batched_entropy() to
be after the assignment of crng_init. However, the call to
invalidate_batched_entropy() must be made _before_ the assignment of
crng_init.

Except READ_ONCE ensures that the compiler will never inline it, so it
actually needs to stay.
