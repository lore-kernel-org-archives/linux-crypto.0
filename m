I tried making /dev/urandom block.  The zero day kernel testing within
a few hours told us that Ubuntu LTS at the time and OpenWrt would fail
to boot.  And when Python made a change to call getrandom(2) with the
default blocking semantic instead of using /dev/urandom, some
distributions using systemd stopped booting.

So if you're a security focused individual who is kvetching that we're
asking to force userspace to change to fix "a bug", you need to
understand that making the change you're suggesting will *also*
require making changes to userspace.  And if you want to go try to
convince Linus Torvalds that it's OK to make a backwards-incompatible
changes that break Ubuntu LTS and OpenWRT by causing them to fail to
boot --- be my guest.

And if we're breaking distributions from them booting when their use
of /dev/urandom is not security critical, I suspect Linus is not going
to be impressed that you are breaking those users for no beneft.  (For
example, Python's use of getrandom(2) was to prevent denial of service
attacks when Python is used as a fast-CGI web server script, and it
was utterly pointless from security perspective to block when the
python script was creating on-demand systemd unit files, where the DOS
threat was completely irrelevant.)

The #ifdef and the printk was there from the very beginning.

    random: add debugging code to detect early use of get_random_bytes()

    Signed-off-by: "Theodore Ts'o" <tytso@mit.edu>

It was four years ago, so I don't remember the exact circumstances,
but if I recall the issue was not wanting to spam the dmesg.  Also, at
the time, we hadn't yet created the asynchronous interfaces that allow
kernel code to do the right thing, even if it was massively
inconvenient.

At this point, I think we should be completely open to making it be a
config option, and if it looks like for common configs we're not
spamming dmesg, we could even it make it be the default.  We just also
need to give driver writers some easy-to-understand receipes to fix
their drivers to do the right thing.  If we do that first, it's much
more likely they will actually fix their kernel code, instead of just
turning the warning off.

What, you mean as a computer scientist you didn't immediately
understand that csma doesn't refer to CSMA/CD --- or "Carrier-sense
multiple access with collision avoidance"?  For shame!  :-)

This is basically the exponential backoff which used in ethernet
networks, and the *real* answer is that they should be using
prandom_u32().

It appears to be accessing a hardware cryptographic processor
function, and seems to do its own entropy gathering relying on stack
garbage as well as using get_random_bytes().  By default it is defined
as a module, so I suspect in most situations it's called
post-userspace, but agreed that it is not guaranteed to be the case.
I think in practice most IBM customers will be safe because they tend
to use distro kernels that will almost certainly be building it as a
module, but your point is well taken.

This is a fair point.

That developer was Herbert Xu, and he added it about two years ago.
See commit 205a525c3342.

So the problem with doing this by default, for all modules, is that on
those platforms which don't have good hardware support for seeding the
non-blocking pool quickly, if we defer all modules, we will also be
deferring the means by which we get the entropy needed to seed the
non-blocking pool.  So for example, if you have a bunch of networking
drivers that are using get_random_bytes() for exponential backoff,
when they *should* be using prandom_u32(), if we don't fix *that* bug,
simply deferring the module load will also defer the entropy input
from the networking interrupts from the networking card.

So while I agree that auditing all calls to get_random_bytes() is
fragile from a security robustness perspective, and I certainly agree
that it is onerous, some amount of it is still going to have to be
done.  And for things like the S390 PRNG (which is supposed to be
generating cryptorgaphically secure random numbers), probably we
should just fix it to use the add_random_ready_callback() interface
since even if in practice most users will be safe, we shouldn't be
depending on it.

Adding a patch to make DEBUG_RANDOM_BOOT a Kconfig option also is a
really good first step, for someone who wants to take this on as a
project.
