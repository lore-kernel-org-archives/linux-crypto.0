Hi Marcel,

I think the akcipher operations for sign/verify/encrypt/decrypt should operate on asymmetric keys in the first place. With akcipher you are pretty much bound to public and private keys and the key is the important part and not the akcipher itself. Especially since we want to support private keys in hardware (like TPM for example).

The main use case for algif_akcipher will be to allow a web server, which needs to handle
tens of thousand TLS handshakes per second, to offload the RSA operation to a HW accelerator.
Do you think we can use keyctl for this?
Thanks,
