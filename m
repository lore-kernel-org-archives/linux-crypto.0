A significant portion of the use cases should include mobile devices.
Device sales outnumbered desktop and server sales several years ago.

Many devices are sensor rich. Even the low-end ones come with
accelorometers for gaming. A typical one has 3 or 4 sensors, and
higher-end ones have 7 or 8 sensors. An Evo 4G has 7 of them.

There's no wanting for entropy in many of the use cases. The thing
that is lacking seems to be taking advantage of it.
