All the distro kernels I'm aware of have DEBUG_KERNEL=y.

Where all includes at least RHEL, SLES, Fedora, Ubuntu & Debian.

So it's still essentially default y.

Emitting *one* warning by default would be reasonable. That gives users
who are interested something to chase, they can then turn on the option
to get the full story.

Filling the dmesg buffer with repeated warnings is really not helpful.
