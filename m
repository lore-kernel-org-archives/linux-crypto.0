Isn't the question of "should the API use physical or virtual addresses"
independent of the question of "should the API support asynchronous requests"?
You can already choose, via the flags and mask arguments when allocating a
crypto transform, whether you want it to be synchronous or asynchronous or
whether you don't care.  I don't see what that says about whether the API should
take in physical memory (e.g. scatterlists or struct pages) or virtual memory
(e.g. iov_iters or just regular pointers).

And while it's true that asynchronous algorithms are often provided by hardware
drivers that operate on physical memory, it's not always the case.  For example
some of the AES-NI algorithms are asynchronous only because they use the SSE
registers which can't always available to kernel code, so the request may need
to be processed by another thread.
