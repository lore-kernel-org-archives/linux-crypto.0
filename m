so you need to find a another way then. Doing the assignment after
dropping the lock opens another race.

I don't think the compiler is allowed to inline it the way you describe
it. This would render any assignment to local variable useless. Also
the READ_ONCE creates worse code in this case (because the read can not
be delayed).
