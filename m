I only proposed to get rid of the log messages indicating a non-seeded DRNG.

But you bring up an interesting point: if it is true you say that it is hard 
for people to use differnent types of APIs regarding entropy and random 
numbers right (which I would concur with), and considering that you imply that 
get_random_bytes, get_random_u32 and get_random_u64 have the same security 
strength, why do we have these three APIs to begin with? The get_random_bytes 
API would then be more than enough.

Ciao
