Fix all the problems *how*?  If you are on an old system which doesn't
a hardware random number generator, and which doesn't have a high
resolution cycle counter, and may not have a lot of entropy easily
harvestable from the environment, there may not be a lot you can do.
Sure, you can pretend that the cache (which by the way is usually
determinstic) is ***so*** complicated that no one can figure it out,
and essentially pretend that you have entropy when you probably don't;
that just simply becomes a different way of handwaving and suppressing
the warning messages.

Blocking the boot for hours and hours until we have enough entropy to
initialize the CRNG is ***not*** an acceptable way of making the
warning messages go away.  Do that and the users **will** mutiny.

It's this sort of attitude which is why Linus has in the past said
that security people are sometimes insane....
