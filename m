It's not _my_ API, it's *our* API --- that is the Linux kernel
community's.  And part of the rules of this community is that we very
much don't break backwards compatibility, unless there is a really
good reason, where Linus gets to decide if it's a really good reason.
So if you care a lot about this issue, then you need to do the work to
make the change, and part of it is showing, to a high degree of
certainty, that it won't break backwards compatibility.

Because if you don't, and you flout community norms, and users get
broken, and they complain, and you tell them to suck it, then Linus
will pull out is patented clue stick, and tell you that you have in
fact flouted community norms, correct you publically, and then revert
your change.

If you are using the word *you*, and speaking as an outside to the
community, they you can kvetch all you like.  But you're an outsider,
and don't have to listen to you.  But if you want to make a positive
difference here, and you're passionate about it --- this is you would
need to do.  That being said, we're all volunteers, so if you don't
want to bother, that's fine.  But then don't be surprised if we don't
take your complaints seriously.

This is open source --- want to send patches?  It sounds like it's a
workable, good idea.

...or that I disagree with your prior point.  I think you're being
lazy, and trying to make it someone else's problem and standing on the
side lines and complaining, as opposed to trying to help solve the
problem.

No, of course we can't audit all of the code, but it's probably a good
idea to take a random sample, and to analyze them, so we can get a
sense of what the issues are.  And then maybe we can find a way to
quickly find a class of users that can be easily fixed by using
prandom_u32() (for example).

Or maybe we can then help figure out what percentage of the callsites
can be fixed with a synchronous interface, and fix some number of them
just to demonstrate that the synchronous interface does work well.

It depends on where it's being used.  If it's part of module load,
especially if it's one that's done automatically, having something
that blocks forever might not be all that useful.  Especially if it
blocks device drivers from being albe to be initialized enough to
actually supply entropy to the whole system.

Or maybe (in the case of stack canaries), the answer is we should
start with crappy random numbers, but then once the random number
generator has been initialized, we can use the callback to get
cryptographically secure random number generators, and then we need to
figure out how to phase out use of the old crappy random numbers and
substitute in the exclusive use of the good random numbers.  Because
saying that we'll just simply not allow any processes to start until
we have good random numbers, which means we can't load the kernel
modules, and we're running on an architecture which doesn't have
RDRAND or even a high-resolution clock, may mean that we're in a world
of hurt.

And simply saying *your* system is buggy, or *your* system is
fundamentally broken, isn't particularly helpful.  Yes, *we* have Linux
routers using MIPS processors which don't have much in the way of
entropy gathering facilities or true random number generation.  Simply
bricking them so we can say, "yay, our system is no longer buggy", is
not acceptable.  So the question is whether you're going to help make
things incrementally better, or just sit on the sidelines and kvetch.

And if your answer is just, "blah blah di blah blah", don't be
surprised if others respond to you in exactly the same way.
Specifically, by saying to you (in your words), "I don't care".

I think making it a Kconfig option which defaults to true is the
better approach.  At the very least let's make sure that on a range of
"standard x86 developer machines", we're not spamming dmesg.  If we
are, simply turning it on and standing on principle, "we're the
cryptographers and we get to decide what is right and holy", and if
lots of people start complaining about how it makes their machine
usuable, that's exactly the same kind of arrogance which caused kernel
developers to become incensed by systemd developers when they spammed
dmesg and made kernel developers' systems unusuable.  Would you be
upset if systemd developers did it unto you?  Then maybe you shouldn't
do it unto others....
