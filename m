This is a mandatory, non-optional feature of getrandom(2).

It will always block or return EAGAIN until it has sufficient entropy.
This is true both for the GRND_RANDOM or !GRND_RANDOM modes.

There are already people whining about how they can't use this
interface to get best efforts randomness for srand().  I'm not
planning meeting their request; non-crypto code which wants to use
random() or rand() can either use the standard getpid()/time()
mechanisms to initialize their PRNG, or they can try to open
/dev/urandom and do things the old fashioned way.  Cry me a river.....

P.S.  Because the ARM architecture does not guarantee a cycle counter
(and apparently using the cycle counter when it is not present cause a
crash, and there's apparently no way to determine whether the cycle
counter is present), entropy collection on ARM is a problem, and so
this new behaviour may be problematic on some architectures,
especially if some part of the system like systemd wants to use
getrandom(2) in very early boot.

However, this is a new interface, so if it causes problems on ARM and
other broken architectures, tough noogies.  Hopefully this will
gradually increase pressure on the ARM folks to fix their broken
CPU architectuure specification...
