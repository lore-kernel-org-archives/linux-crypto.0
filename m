As I said in my original message, I *tried* this as an experiment.
Because lots of security-obsessed people were disputing my
intelligence, my judgement, and in some cases, my paternity becuase I
wouldn't change /dev/urandom not to block.

So I did the experiment so I could give them hard data about why we
couldn't go down that path.

And indeed, making this change brick'ed at least one version of Ubuntu
and one version of CeroWRT, as reported by the kernel's 0-day testing
system.  As a result, this patch (which was always a proof of concept,
not anything I thought had any chance of going upstream), was dropped.

Since in the kernel, We Do Not Break Backwards Compatibility, this is
why we have a new interface --- getrandom(2) --- instead of changing
an existing interface.  (Well, there were multiple good reasons for
getrandom, but this was definitely one of them.)
