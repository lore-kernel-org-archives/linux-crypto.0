I think that for the purpose of using crypto-user in an AF_ALG scenario, even 
searching for the highest priporty will not necessarily give you the reference 
to the cipher used in AF_ALG. In the time between AF_ALG initialized a cipher 
and the time crypto-user is called, a new driver could register that may have 
even a higher priority than the one driver currently active for AF_ALG.

Therefore, from my perspective of AF_ALG and considering that all drivers of 
the same name should be identical, I would not suggest add more code to 
resolve the highest priority as I do not see the value of it.
