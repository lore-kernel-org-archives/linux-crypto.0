Hm, there really is no such license as "Public domain" that works in all
countries, sorry.  You will note it's not one of the "valid module
license list" we have in module.h because of that.

So, I don't know where you got the code from, but perhaps "Dual BSD/GPL"
is the correct one for you?

Note, I'm not a lawyer, so this isn't legal advice about the license of
code, but I do spend way too much time with lawyers dealing with license
issues...

Ah much better.

Given that this would be the first use of it in the kernel, it might be
too much rice :)

Unless you can show real numbers that it actually matters, I wouldn't do
it, it's not worth the hassle.  That's the same rule for when you use
likely()/unlikely(), if you can not measure it, don't use it as you
almost always get it wrong, the compiler is smarter, and keeps getting
better over time.

Nope, I just have to ask :)

If it's dual licensed, a normal EXPORT_SYMBOL() is just fine, I have no
objection to that at all.
