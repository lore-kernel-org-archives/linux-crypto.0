Ok. But in the code you see that skcipher is a 100% subset of AEAD. For 
AEAD, all we need to do in addition to normal symmetric ciphers is to 
select the AEAD kernel crypto API calls, to locate and use the AD and to 
ensure we have the right memory size to process the tag.

How about the following:

Use algif_skcipher.c as the common code which requires:

- function pointers for the kernel crypto API backends

- function pointers for the AEAD specific handling which are invoked at 
the right places -- they are NULL in case of skcipher

When we have a separate algif_aead, then I guess we want to allow 
skcipher and aead to be configured and compiled independently.

That raises the question where the common code should go? I would not 
suggest to put it into a header file. However, when adding it to a C 
file, how do you propose it should be considered in the Makefile. That C 
file needs to be compile once with either skcipher or aead.
