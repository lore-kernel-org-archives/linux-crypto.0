This isn't an issue with AF_ALG, I should have changed the subject
line perhaps.  In this case it's an inconsistency between some
implementations and the documentation (header comment).  It affects
users accessing the cipher through AF_ALG but also directly.

It's that client code doesn't need an intermediate layer with an
additional buffer and a memcpy to provide a sensible API.  If the code
wants to decrypt a 32-byte Digest Info structure with a given key or a
reference to a key it makes no sense, logically or in terms of
performance, for it to provide a key-sized buffer.

In the case of the userspace interface I think it's also rare for a
recv() or read() on Linux to require a buffer larger than it's going
to use, correct me if i'm wrong.  (I.e. fail if given a 32-byte
buffer, return 32 bytes of data anyway)  Turning your questino around
is there a gain from requiring larger buffers?

Best regards
