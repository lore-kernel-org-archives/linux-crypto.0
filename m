What you want is AIO so we should try to use that interface rather
than creating some funky crypto-specific interface.

Dave, the AIO hooks in net/socket.c is currently simply pointing
to the sync implementation.  What are you thoughts on allowing
socket implementations to supply these hooks?

The algif interface can then use these hooks to implement AIO
which is useful for maximising the hardware performance without
resorting to loads of threads.

Cheers,
