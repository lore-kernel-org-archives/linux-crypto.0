Separately from this there's a problem with the user being unable to
know if the algorithm is going to fail because of destination buffer
size != key size (including kernel users).  For RSA, the qat
implementation will fail while the software implementation won't.  For
pkcs1pad(...) there's currently just one implementation but the user
can't assume that.

Best regards
