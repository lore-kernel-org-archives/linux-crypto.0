A few manpages might actually have warnings to that effect, but it is not
the rule.  Amusingly enough, the one for read(2) does, while open(2) does
not.

IMHO the getrandom(2) case is slightly different: we already know to a high
degree of confidence that we will want to convey a "permission denied"
condition to userspace for getrandom(GRND_RANDOM) sooner or later.

I'd be fine with text that mentions that GRND_RANDOM access by a process
may be restricted/rejected by system policy in the future, so code should
not assume any error return code from getrandom(GRND_RANDOM) would also
apply to getrandom() without GRND_RANDOM, and must degrade gracefully and
safely in that case.

Well, I feel we could go a bit further than usual for getrandom(2), but
I've already stated my case.
