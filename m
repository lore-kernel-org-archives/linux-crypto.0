actually in embedded devices (especially the tiny IoT stuff I am looking after) I really want keys in a central place and do not have to copy them around all the time. Keeping keys secure is actually a hard job. Doing that multiple places in the kernel and in userspace seems not a good idea. Especially not for an embedded device.

The keys subsystem is great since it includes access control to your keys. If you have the right permissions you can get the keys back out if you want to. However if the key is locked down, you will not be able to read it again.

I mean the keys subsystem can operate on per user, per process and per thread keys and access rights. So the policy that you are after is already done nicely via the keys subsystem. I really don't think we are limiting anything here. We are actually giving users more choice for policy.

Reality is that TLS in the kernel is happening. Reality is also that we do signing and certificate handling in the kernel. How much of the cipher negotiations and key derivation happens in kernel vs userspace is something to be still discussed. And there will be userspace involved for sure. However that does not mean that we keep moving keys through userspace to just load it back into another subsystem. That kind of API really needs to stop.

One other note I make is that we are looking at such tiny systems that including OpenSSL or GnuTLS is not an option at all. However we do use secure boot and need to be able to handle certificates and TLS.

Ciphers itself are easy of course. What we are saying here is that we do not have the cipher as the main important input on what to do. We have the key itself. The key decides what options for ciphers or fallback ciphers we have. So let me repeat this, we need to think really hard about supporting hardware keys. We need to see the bigger picture. Just looking at ciphers is not enough.
