This may be a reasonable use case, but note this cannot just be the regular
"zstd" compression setting, since filesystem compression by default must provide
reasonable performance for many different access patterns.  See the patch in
this series which actually adds zstd compression to btrfs; it only uses level 1.
I do not see a patch which adds a higher compression mode.  It would need to be
a special setting like "zstdhc" that users could opt-in to on specific
directories.  It also would need to be compared to simply compressing in
userspace.  In many cases compressing in userspace is probably the better
solution for the use case in question because it works on any filesystem, allows
using any compression algorithm, and if random access is not needed it is
possible to compress each file as a single stream (like a .xz file), which
produces a much better compression ratio than the block-by-block compression
that filesystems have to use.

Note also that LZ4HC is in the kernel source tree currently but no one is using
it vs. the regular LZ4.  I think it is the kind of thing that sounded useful
originally, but at the end of the day no one really wants to use it in kernel
mode.  I'd certainly be interested in actual patches, though.
