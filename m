Large data-sets with WORM access patterns and infrequent writes 
immediately come to mind as a use case for the highest compression level.

As a more specific example, the company I work for has a very large 
amount of documentation, and we keep all old versions.  This is all 
stored on a file server which is currently using BTRFS.  Once a document 
is written, it's almost never rewritten, so write performance only 
matters for the first write.  However, they're read back pretty 
frequently, so we need good read performance.  As of right now, the 
system is set to use LZO compression by default, and then when a new 
document is added, the previous version of that document gets 
re-compressed using zlib compression, which actually results in pretty 
significant space savings most of the time.  I would absolutely love to 
use zstd compression with this system with the highest compression 
level, because most people don't care how long it takes to write the 
file out, but they do care how long it takes to read a file (even if 
it's an older version).
