I'm not sure I understand the rationale; if someone can eat all your
file descriptors, he can make you stop working. So you can just stop
working when you can't open /dev/urandom, no?

Fallback code is probably very bad idea to use...

Sounds like ioctl() for /dev/urandom for this behaviour would be nice?
