Thanks, that helps (especially with pkcs1pad).

This brings me to another proposal for read buffer sizing: AF_ALG akcipher 
can guarantee that partial reads (where the read buffer is shorter than 
the output of the crypto op) will work using the same semantics as 
SOCK_DGRAM/SOCK_SEQPACKET. With those sockets, as much data as will fit is 
copied in to the read buffer and the remainder is discarded.

I realize there's a performance and memory tradeoff, since the crypto 
algorithm needs a sufficiently large output buffer that would have to be 
created by AF_ALG akcipher. The user could manage that tradeoff by 
providing a larger buffer (typically key_size?) if it wants to avoid 
allocating and copying intermediate buffers inside the kernel.
