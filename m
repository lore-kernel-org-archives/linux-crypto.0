Please forgive my ignorance... What do the last two sentence mean exactly?

If I am running a production Debian, Fedora or Ubuntu kernel, will a
messages be present if a violation occurs? A "violation" is a policy
violation, and I mean a generator is used before its operational.

Sunlight is the best disinfectant. At least one message should be
logged to ensure the issue is known. But its not clear to me if that's
what happens when trying to parse the last two sentences.
