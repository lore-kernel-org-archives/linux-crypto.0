AFAIUI, the intent is to extend the compression type specification for 
both the mount options and the property, not to add a new mount option. 
I think we all agree that `mount -o compress=zstd3` is a lot better than 
`mount -o compress=zstd,compresslevel=3`.

Are properties set on the root subvolume inherited properly?  Because 
unless they are, we can't get the same semantics.

Two other counter arguments on completely removing BTRFS-specific mount 
options:
1. It's a lot easier and a lot more clearly defined to change things 
that affect global behavior of the FS by a remount than having to 
iterate everything in the FS to update properties.  If I'm disabling 
autodefrag, I'd much rather just `mount -o remount,noautodefrag` than 
`find / -xdev -exec btrfs property set \{\} autodefrag false`, as the 
first will take effect for everything simultaneously and run 
exponentially quicker.
2. There are some things that don't make sense as per-object settings or 
are otherwise nonsensical on objects.  Many, but not all, of the BTRFS 
specific mount options fall into this category IMO, with the notable 
exception of compress[-force], [no]autodefrag, [no]datacow, and 
[no]datasum.  Some other options do make sense as properties of the 
filesystem (commit, flushoncommit, {inode,space}_cache, max_inline, 
metadata_ratio, [no]ssd, and [no]treelog are such options), but many are 
one-off options that affect behavior on mount (like skip_balance, 
clear_cache, nologreplay, norecovery, usebbackuproot, and subvol).
