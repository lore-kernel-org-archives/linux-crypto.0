I'm not sure what warning you are worried about?  urandom_read() never
uses file or ppos, so passing in NULL works just fine as near as I can
tell.

I could refactor the entropy point, but it probably wouldn't add any
extra bloat, since the compiler would hopefully compile it away, but
adding the extra static function would seem to make things less
readable at least in my opinion.
