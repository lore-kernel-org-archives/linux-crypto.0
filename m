I might be missing something here, but the command line is inside of the
device tree, at /chosen/bootargs, so modifying the kernel command line
*is* modifying the device tree in-memory.

For arm64, we have a /chosen/kaslr-seed property that we hope
FW/bootloaders fill in, and similar could be done for some initial
entropy, provided appropriate HW/FW support.

Thanks,
Mark.
