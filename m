   Could we please not add more mount options? I get that they're easy
to implement, but it's a very blunt instrument. What we tend to see
(with both nodatacow and compress) is people using the mount options,
then asking for exceptions, discovering that they can't do that, and
then falling back to doing it with attributes or btrfs properties.
Could we just start with btrfs properties this time round, and cut out
the mount option part of this cycle.

   In the long run, it'd be great to see most of the btrfs-specific
mount options get deprecated and ultimately removed entirely, in
favour of attributes/properties, where feasible.

   Hugo.
